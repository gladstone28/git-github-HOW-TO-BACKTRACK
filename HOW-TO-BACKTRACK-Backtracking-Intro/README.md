### HOW TO BACKTRACK

**Backtracking Intro**

When working on a Git project, sometimes we make changes that we want to get rid of. Git offers a few eraser-like features that allow us to undo mistakes during project creation. In this lesson, we’ll learn some of these features.

To start out, let’s review the basic Git workflow.


### Instructions

Checkpoint 1 Passed
1. You are in a Git project titled hamlet-prince-of-denmark. In the code editor, you’ll be working on scene-5.txt. Here, Hamlet encounters the ghost of his father. Add this text to the file:

Ghost: 
My hour is almost come,
When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames
Must render up myself.


2. From the terminal, add scene-5.txt to the staging area.

3. Commit the changes to the repository with a good commit message.
